# Object-Oriented Languages

- The focus of OOP languages is on **modeling data**, not on structure.
- Everything in OOP is grouped as self-sustainable "objects". Hence, you gain re-usability by means of four main object-oriented programming concepts



## Classes and Objects

> - A class is a prototype, idea and blueprint for creating objects.
> - An object is an instance of a class
> - A class has a constructor for creating objects



## OOP Basic Concepts

#### Enclapsulation

> - The wrapping up of data and function together, into a single unit is called encapsulation.
> - A mechanism of restricting data access to some of the object's component.



#### Inheritance

> - Derived class which is inherited from base class, can access to features of base class.



#### Abstraction

> - Abstraction hides certain details and only show the essential features of the object.



#### Polymorphism

> - The ability of different object to respond, each in its own way, to identical messages is called polymorphism.
